# Mongoose 
## using mongoose and mongodb for data storage.

This application should be able to take information put into forms validate and save that information so that users can be emailed later about their interest.
I am using separate model, view, routes, and controllers folders, which for the most part is helping it stay organized, but it is new to me.
Unfortuneately I cannot get this to happen I have looked over the book and online for help, but still do not understand how to make mongoose work with this information.
